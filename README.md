# sort1

A small repository containing implementations and examples of sorting algorithms. This README provides an overview of the project, how to explore the code, and basic contribution guidelines.

## Contents

- Implementations: Look in the repository for language-specific folders (for example `src/`, `python/`, `js/`, or similar). Each implementation should include its own README or comments explaining how to build and run.
- Tests / Examples: Example inputs and test harnesses (if present) are typically in `tests/` or in the same folders as the implementations.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/Sambsamb/sort1.git
   cd sort1

2. Find the implementation you want to run. For example:
   - If there's a `python/` folder: run `python3 <file>.py` or follow that folder's README.
   - If there is a `src/` or language folder, check its README or comments for build/run instructions.

3. Run tests (if present):
   - If the repository includes a test suite, run it with the language's normal test runner (pytest, npm test, go test, etc.).

## Example

A typical example to run a sorting implementation in Python might look like:

python3 python/quicksort.py

Or in Node.js:

node js/quicksort.js

Adjust commands based on the actual repository structure.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome.

- Open an issue to discuss larger changes.
- Fork the repository, create a feature branch, and submit a pull request.
- Include tests or examples for new algorithms or changes.

## License

This repository does not include a license file. If you want to apply a license, add a LICENSE file at the repository root (for example, MIT or Apache-2.0).
