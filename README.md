# Sort and Find Median – Coding Test Solution

This project implements a small command-line program that:
1. Sorts a list of numbers using a custom sorting algorithm (Bubble Sort).
2. Computes the median based on the provided pseudocode.

The solution includes:
- A manual sorting function (as required, no built-in sort)
- A function to compute the median
- Example usage
- Optional user input mode
